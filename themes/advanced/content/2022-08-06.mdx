I don't think that the world needed one more developer blog... Probably I need it more than you do.

There are a lot of places on the Wonderful Wild Web where you can find useful stuff,
nice and complete tutorials, framework guides, good advice about the best and fastest languages
out there. This is not one of them.

There are a lot of Front End Gurus, Back End Geniuses, Certified Full Stack Wizard and I admire all of them
(I learned **a lot** reading their posts), but, guess what, I'm not one of them either.

For the last 30 years or so I simply had a lot of fun playing around with everything that was related to
programming languages. I learned some good stuff and a lot of bad stuff. I always liked to write nice code and
seldom I succeeded in this task.

![Where it all began](./images/commodore_64.jpg)

I was approximately eight years old when my uncle gave me a beautiful Commodore 64 for Christmas.
I was so excited... After a few weeks of continuous playing, my father bought a Basic manual;
he explained to me that using those words we could create the games I played and liked so much.
That was **amazing**!

After a while my father picked a code example: with that code we were supposed to draw a hot-air baloon
on the screen and make it fly. We spent five (long) days writing down the code, making a lot of
mistakes, checking every single line in the manual, failing and failing again.

Finally, we ran our program. 4 by 4 white and blue pixels moved from the top left corner to the
bottom right one, then back to the top left one and repeated. You can't imagine my joy watching
those pixels moving in front of my eyes...

To be honest I expected something more... but we created that. **I** created that!

We took one of the cassettes, and we press REC on tape to save our work.

...a couple of days later we couldn't find the cassette with our program in it.

Then we found out that my sister used that same cassette to duplicate a Madonna album.

This is what I learned that day:
- have fun while you're writing your code, because the results will always be disappointing;
- save your code in the cloud;
- Madonna doesn't have any responsibilities in your failures.

I hope that you will always have fun as I did (and do).
