# NuandaWM's Blog source code

This is the code base of my personal blog. That can be found at [nuandawm.xyz](https://nuandawm.xyz).

This Blog has been made using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) and
its [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter).

Feel free to explore, fork, copy-paste and be inspired by this code.
But remember, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is watching,
so put it to good use.

## Getting Started

You can go and run this beautiful website using the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nuandawm/nuandawm-personal-gatsby-advanced-starter.git
cd nuandawm-personal-gatsby-advanced-starter
yarn install
yarn develop
```

But of course it won't work.

You need to add a .env file containing your
[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) API_KEY
```
CONTENTFUL_API_KEY=<past_your_key_here>
```
Of course, I didn't put my API key on this repository: I would never do
a trivial mistake like that... twice.
